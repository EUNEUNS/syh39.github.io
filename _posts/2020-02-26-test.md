# Why are my posts not showing on the front page?
---

> I wonder why my posts are not shown in the first page. I can see them  through jekyll bundler in the local server but not in the real github page.  

- **My local page built with jekyll bundler**

<a href="//syh39.github.io/assets/images/s1.jpg" data-lightbox="s1" data-title="s1">
  <img src="//syh39.github.io/assets/images/s1.jpg" title="Check out s1">
</a>

<a href="//syh39.github.io/assets/images/s1.jpg" data-lightbox="s1">Image #1</a>

- **My real github page on web**

<a href="//syh39.com/assets/images/s2.jpg" data-lightbox="s2" data-title="s2">
  <img src="//syh39.com/assets/images/s2.jpg" title="Check out s2">
</a>
