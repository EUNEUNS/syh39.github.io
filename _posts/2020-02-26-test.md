# Why are my posts not showing on the front page?
---

> I wonder why my posts are not shown on the first page. I can see them through jekyll bundler in the local server but not on the real Github page.  

- ### My local page built with jekyll bundler



<a href="//syh39.github.io/assets/images/s2.jpg" data-lightbox="s2" data-title="s2">
  <img src="//syh39.github.io/assets/images/s2.jpg" title="Check out s2">
</a>


> Works well. I did not touch anything about the firstpage except for tiny designing stuffs.


- ###My real github page on web



<a href="//syh39.github.io/assets/images/s1.jpg" data-lightbox="s1" data-title="s1">
  <img src="//syh39.github.io/assets/images/s1.jpg" title="Check out s1">
</a>


> And have no idea at all. Works differently with the completely same resources. It works like this also with the original Centrarium theme. I have been googling it for a week and found nothing...
